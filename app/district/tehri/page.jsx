          Situated at the confluence of the Bhagirathi and Bhilangna rivers,
          Tehri Garhwal is known for the Tehri Dam, one of the tallest dams in
          the world. The dam, standing at a height of 260.5 meters, generates
          hydroelectric power and also serves as a major source of irrigation
          and drinking water for the region. The vast reservoir created by the
          dam, known as Tehri Lake, has become a hub for water sports and
          adventure activities.

          views of the Himalayas.

          region. The Kunjapuri Temple, perched at an altitude of 1,676 meters,
          is a popular destination for witnessing the mesmerizing sunrise over
          the Himalayan peaks, including Swargarohini and Bandarpunch.
